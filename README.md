## Introduction
The STAR project aims to make audio and video content more accessible by providing users with tools to search and analyze media data efficiently. Instead of manually listening to or taking notes from an entire media piece, STAR allows users to query specific information and receive precise responses. This approach empowers users to save time and enhances accessibility across various fields, including research, journalism, and education.

## Features
- **Transcription and Analysis**: Converts audio and video files into text for easy analysis.
- **Natural Language Querying**: Allows users to ask specific questions and get answers directly from the media content.
- **Summarization**: Automatically summarizes lengthy audio or video files, providing key insights and main points.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies and highlights important keywords and phrases from the content.
- **Multi-language Support**: Works with multiple languages, broadening accessibility for diverse users.
- **Search and Timestamping**: Search for topics, phrases, or keywords within the content, with timestamped results for easy navigation.
